Arb watcher
This is a simple app written in Node JS to watch rates of several cryptocurrency pairs on 3 exchanges (Binance, Bitstamp and Kraken) watching for price differences and potential arbitrage opportunities.  This code does not place any actual trades, but was helpful in discovering trade setups in some of my other (private) bots.
